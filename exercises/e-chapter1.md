# Chapter 1 Practice Exercises

## Problem 1

Rewrite [TwelveDays](../chapter-code/chapter1/TwelveDays.java) in an interative style, as opposed to recursive. What is the impact of this change on the design? Does this change move the solution in the design space? If so, how?

## Problem 2

Change [TwelveDays](../chapter-code/chapter1/TwelveDays.java) so that it is possible to choose between displaying the number of the days written out (for example "third" day), as in the original version, or using digits (for example "3rd day"). If the user includes the command-line argument "digit", the program should use digits. In all other cases, the original, written-out form should be used. What is the impact of your solution on the quality attributes of the design?
