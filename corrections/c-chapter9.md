# Clarifications and Corrections for Chapter 9

* On page 238 method `compareByRank` would be best declared `public` so it can be usable outside the class.
* On page 249 there are two extra parentheses in the first sorting code fragment. See the corrected version as method `sampleSortingApplication1` in [Card.java](../chapter-code/chapter9/Card.java).
